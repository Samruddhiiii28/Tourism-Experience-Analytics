# Tourism Experience Analytics :Classification, Prediction, and Recommendation system
A machine learning project that analyzes tourism behvioral data and predicts travel intent, estimates user satisfaction, and recommends attractions-all deployed in an interactive Stramlit application.

# Project Overview
This project addresses three key challenges in the tourism industry:

1.Visit Mode Prediction-Predict whether a user is traveling for Business, Family, COuples, or Friends using supervised learning.
2.Rating Prediction-Estimate the rating a user likely to give to an attraction using regression modeling.
3.Attraction Recommendation-Recommend attraction using a content-based filtering approach based on user behavior and attraction metadata.
